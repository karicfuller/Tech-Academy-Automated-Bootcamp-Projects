Customized Tokidoki Website
For this project, we were supposed to build a space station website that I customized into a website about The World of Tokidoki. It was a fun project that showed how to display images and layouts using HTML and CSS.

Movie Theatre Site
For this project, I created a page that displayed movies that were showing at a movie theatre in Downtown San Luis Obispo, CA. It shows movies, descriptions, and showing times for each movie. 

Smiley Face CSS Features
This project showed how to use CSS features such as hovering and transitional effects on images.

Personal Portfolio
This is a portfolio page that tells a bit about myself and my career and provides a link to my GitHub site.
