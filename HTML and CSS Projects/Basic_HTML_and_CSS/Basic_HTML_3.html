                Once upon a time, a boy named Pity found a cute baby bear abandoned in the woods.<br> 
                He took the bear home with him and raised him until he was full-sized.<br> 
                Unfortunately, the bear (named GLOOMY) retained all his animal nature and sometimes<br> 
                brutally attacks Pity despite all the love and the deep bond the two now share.
